# Deploying xsteer.in

| | Host | Serves | Deploys when |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Dev** | `dev.xsteer.in` | whatever branch you are working on — unstable | `cargo xtask dev` |
| **Beta** | `beta.xsteer.in` | `main`, and only `main` — the release candidate | every push to `main` |
| **Production** | `xsteer.in`, `www.xsteer.in` | the last tagged release | a `v*.*.*` tag, pushed or rolled back to |

Each environment means exactly one thing, which is what makes the release gate worth
anything: because beta serves only `main`, a green run there is evidence about the commit
being tagged rather than about whichever branch was previewed last. Only production is
indexable — `web/scripts/seo.mjs` fails closed, so dev and beta both carry
`X-Robots-Tag: noindex, nofollow`.

Both serve the same code from an assets-only Cloudflare Worker. The builds differ in
exactly one respect: `DEPLOY_ENV=beta` bakes in `noindex` and a `Disallow: /` robots.txt,
so the beta site can never compete with the real one in search.

`web/scripts/seo.mjs` **defaults to noindex** when `DEPLOY_ENV` is unset. A broken
workflow costs a deploy, never the domain's search presence.

## The release flow

```bash
git switch -c feat/thing            # work; tests run on every push
cargo xtask dev                     # push the branch, preview it on dev.xsteer.in
cargo xtask prepare-release minor   # bump the version, open a CHANGELOG section
cargo xtask dev                     # preview the release commit itself

gh pr create && gh pr merge --squash
git checkout main && git pull       # main's push deploys beta automatically
cargo xtask release --wait          # waits for that beta run, then tags
```

### Squash merging and the beta gate

A squash produces a **new commit** on `main` that no branch preview ever covered, so a
gate keyed to the branch tip would not hold. It does not need to: pushing to `main`
deploys beta, and `release` gates on *that* run — covering exactly the artifact
production is about to serve. This is a stronger check than gating on the pre-merge
branch, not a weaker one.

The only cost is ordering. The post-merge beta deploy takes about 35 seconds, and
`release` refuses until it is green. `--wait` blocks for it (up to ten minutes) instead
of making you poll; without it, the error names which state you are in — no run yet, one
still running, or one that failed.

### What `cargo xtask release` refuses

| Refuses when | Because |
|---|---|
| not on `main`, or the tree is dirty | a release must be a commit that exists |
| `main` ≠ `origin/main` | tagging a stale local `main` produces a release nobody can find |
| the tag already exists, locally or on origin | versions are not reusable |
| no Deploy Beta run succeeded for this exact SHA | beta is only a gate if promotion checks it |

The tag name comes from `[workspace.package] version` in `Cargo.toml` and is never
typed, so the two cannot drift. `--skip-beta-check` exists for the case where you know
why the run is missing; it is a deliberate override, not a fallback.

## Scripted setup

Steps 1–2 and 5 can be done from the terminal instead of two dashboards —
`scripts/setup-dns.sh` drives the Cloudflare API and Spaceship's public API.
Read-only first:

```bash
./scripts/setup-dns.sh status
```

Credentials come from the environment and are never echoed. Keep them outside the
repo:

```bash
set -a; source ~/.xsteer-env; set +a
./scripts/setup-dns.sh apply
./scripts/setup-dns.sh wait
```

Two things the script cannot do for you: creating the Cloudflare API token and
creating the Spaceship API key both require their respective dashboards once.

Note that zone creation needs a **different, broader token** than CI uses — the Workers
token in step 3 below cannot create zones. Make a temporary one with `Zone:Zone:Edit`
and `Zone:DNS:Edit`, then delete it when setup is done.

---

## One-time setup

Steps 1–4 are manual and can only be done by the account owner.

### 1. Add the domain to Cloudflare

Create a Cloudflare account if you do not have one, then **Add a domain** → `xsteer.in`
→ **Free** plan.

### 2. Move the nameservers at Spaceship

`xsteer.in` currently uses Spaceship's nameservers:

```text
launch1.spaceship.net
launch2.spaceship.net
```

Cloudflare's free plan cannot run alongside them — CNAME-only (partial) setup is a
Business-plan feature. So the domain has to move to the two nameservers Cloudflare
assigns you.

In the Spaceship dashboard: **Domains → xsteer.in → Nameservers → Custom**, and replace
both with Cloudflare's pair. Propagation is usually under an hour.

> `xfina.dev` uses the same Spaceship nameservers but is a separate zone — moving
> `xsteer.in` does not affect it.

Verify:

```bash
dig +short NS xsteer.in
```

### 3. Create a Cloudflare API token

**My Profile → API Tokens → Create Token → "Edit Cloudflare Workers"** template.

Then confirm the token grants all of the following, adding any the template omits:

| Scope | Permission | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Account | Workers Scripts → Edit | deploy the Worker |
| Zone (`xsteer.in`) | Workers Routes → Edit | bind the custom domains |
| Zone (`xsteer.in`) | DNS → Edit | `custom_domain` routes create DNS records |

Copy the token once — Cloudflare will not show it again. Your **Account ID** is on the
right-hand side of any Cloudflare dashboard page.

### 4. Add the GitHub secrets

```bash
gh secret set CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN  --repo xsteer-in/xsteer
gh secret set CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID --repo xsteer-in/xsteer
```

### 5. First deploy

Push to `main` and the **Deploy Beta** workflow runs. Wrangler creates the
`beta.xsteer.in` custom domain and its DNS record on first deploy — there is nothing to
add in the Cloudflare DNS tab by hand. The same is true of `dev.xsteer.in` the first
time `cargo xtask dev` runs.

Production goes out on a tag, which `cargo xtask release` creates from the workspace
version:

```bash
cargo xtask release
```

---

## Optional: redirect www to the apex

Both `xsteer.in` and `www.xsteer.in` are bound to the production Worker, and the page
declares `xsteer.in` as canonical, so search engines will not treat them as duplicates.
If you would rather `www` redirect outright, add a Cloudflare **Redirect Rule** (Rules →
Redirect Rules, free on any plan): match hostname `www.xsteer.in`, 301 to
`https://xsteer.in${uri.path}`, then drop the `www` route from `wrangler.jsonc`.

---

## Deploying by hand

Rarely needed, but useful when debugging the pipeline. Requires `wrangler login` or
`CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` in your shell.

```bash
npm install          # installs wrangler at the repo root
npm run deploy:beta
npm run deploy:production
```

---

## Rolling back

Production serves whichever tag was deployed last, so rolling back is deploying an
earlier one. Run **Deploy Prod** from `main`, naming the tag:

```bash
gh workflow run deploy-prod.yml --field tag=v0.2.4
```

It runs from `main` and names the tag rather than being dispatched *at* the tag, because
`workflow_dispatch` resolves the workflow file from the ref it is given. Dispatching
`v0.2.4` fails outright — `deploy-prod.yml` does not exist at that tag, only
`deploy-production.yml` does — and for a newer tag it would quietly run that tag's frozen
copy of the workflow, guards included, so a later fix to the deploy path would never
reach the rollback that needed it. Only the code being built comes from the tag.

The tag must match `v*.*.*`, exist, and be on `main`, so the rollback path cannot put
untagged code on the live site either. Nothing is rewritten: `main` and the version in
`Cargo.toml` still say what they said, and the next release rolls forward from there.

Cloudflare also keeps every deployed version, which is the faster route when the deploy
itself is the problem rather than the code:

```bash
npx wrangler deployments list --name xsteer
npx wrangler rollback --name xsteer
```

For beta, use `--name xsteer-beta`.

---

## Troubleshooting

**Custom domain stuck on "Initializing"** — the zone's nameservers have not finished
moving. Re-check step 2; wrangler cannot create a route on a zone Cloudflare does not
yet serve.

**`Authentication error [code: 10000]`** — the token is missing one of the three scopes
in step 3. DNS → Edit is the one the Workers template most often leaves out.

**Beta is showing up in Google** — check the deploy log for
`seo: DEPLOY_ENV=beta → noindex`, then confirm `curl -sI https://beta.xsteer.in`
returns `x-robots-tag: noindex, nofollow`.
